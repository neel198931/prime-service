PURPOSE:

[
  Program with a simple multi-threaded client-server code in Java. Learned to apply the design 
  principle "Program to interface and not to implementation". Learned to implement Singleton 
  Design Pattern. 
  The program runs server and client. Multiple clients can connect to a server. A client can
  send a query to find if a number is prime. Server sends response to client and save client
  requests in a data structure. A menu is displayed at server and client to make interaction
  with user.
]

TO COMPILE:

[
  Just extract the files and then run following command in primeService directory
  ant -buildfile src/build.xml all

]

TO RUN:

[
  Please run below command from directory where this README is present
  For server - 
  ant -buildfile src/build.xml run -Darg0=server -Darg1=<port number> -Darg2=<debug value>

  For client -
  ant -buildfile src/build.xml run -Darg0=client -Darg1=<hostname> -Darg2=<port number>
   -Darg3=<debug value>

  Debug value should be between 0 to 3 for dubug purpose as below -
  3 [Print to log file everytime a method other than a constructor is called.]
  2 [Print to log file everytime a constructr is called]
  1 [Print to log file everytime query is stored in server data structure.]
  0 [No output will be printed]

]
